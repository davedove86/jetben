					originally started out my time in the police training to be a search dog, but because I
					had such good skills working with people I was transferred to work with my handler Claire.</p> <p>So, I am now a Community Engagement dog for Durham Constabulary.</p> <p>I love my job now; as every day is such fun; I get to visit lots of new places and meet
					lots of interesting new people; but I also help to keep people safe and that is extremely
					important.</p> <p>I guess you would like to know more about me, well I work as part of a team with my
					colleague Ben and Claire.</p></div> <img src="/../jet/jet-1.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"></div> <div class="grid-col-2" data-svelte-h="svelte-1uro062"><img src="/../jet/jet-2.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <div><p>I am the wild one though, I love to run all the time and when I go to any new places I get
					so excited that there are times I cannot help but scream.</p> <p>My favourite thing in the whole wide world is a tennis ball, I love; love; love tennis
					balls, I ask for a new one every birthday.</p> <p>I also love going for long walks as exercise is good for me and keeps me fit and healthy.</p> <p>I live at home with my handler Claire, the family and my teammate Ben, since I am the
					youngest, I do like to annoy Ben sometimes; but isnâ€™t that what all younger siblings do.</p> <p>I love working with Claire as since I have been here she is helping me to learn new skills
					like how to be a wellbeing dog; so not only will I be helping members of the public.</p> <p>I will also be helping the police officers and staff I work with to think about their own
					wellbeing when dealing with traumatic incidents and sometimes my colleagues do have deal
					with some very difficult things and it is brilliant that I can help them.</p></div></div> <div class="center svelte-1ma0mcl" data-svelte-h="svelte-10b1fxt"><p>Well I think that is everything you need to know about me.</p> <p>Bye for now.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1ma0mcl">Jet</h3> <img src="/../black-paw-icon.svg" alt="Black paw print" class="svelte-1ma0mcl"></div> <h2 class="center svelte-1ma0mcl" data-svelte-h="svelte-lbghgz">Some pictures of Jet</h2> <div class="grid-col-3 center svelte-1ma0mcl" data-svelte-h="svelte-wdht3i"><img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-1.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-2.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-3.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-4.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-5.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"> <img class="profile-image svelte-1ma0mcl" src="/../jet/jet-6.jpg" alt="Jet the Police Dog"></div> ${validate_component(ContactCta, "ContactCta").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {})}</div> </section>`;
